# Allow metrics and choose their refresh period

The "metrics" service is used to present the amount of data available periodically in an instance of OpenSILEX on concepts (Data, Experiment, Scientific Object)...

Thanks to the configuration file, it is possible to define the system metrics retrieval over a user-defined time period.

Module-core configuration file for metrics key:

```yaml
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Configuration for module: CoreModule (CoreConfig)
core:
  # Metrics options (MetricsConfig)
  metrics:
    # Activate access metrics (boolean)
    enableMetrics: true
    # Metrics configs about system (SystemMetricsConfig)
    system:
      # First metrics for any time depending on is time unit (int)
      timeBeforeFirstMetric: 1
      # Delay between whole system metrics (combined with corresponding TimeUnit) (int)
      delayBetweenMetrics: 30
      # Default metrics units : DAYS, HOURS, MINUTES, SECONDS are authorized (String)
      metricsTimeUnit: DAYS
    # Metrics configs about experiments (ExperimentsMetricsConfig)
    experiments:
      # First metrics for any time depending on is time unit (int)
      timeBeforeFirstMetric: 1
      # Delay between whole system metrics (combined with corresponding TimeUnit) (int)
      delayBetweenMetrics: 7
      # Default metrics units : DAYS, HOURS, MINUTES, SECONDS are authorized (String)
      metricsTimeUnit: DAYS
```

Example, if the time unit is in days for the system, the first measurement will be made on the first day.
The following measurements will be done according to the defined `delayBetweenMetrics` associated with `metricsTimeUnit`.

The calculated metrics are data, scientific object and experiment.

# Variable choice for data visualization

The visualization component displays data associated to a variable, over a specific time period.

Graphic configuration for variable key :

```yaml
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Configuration for module: CoreModule (CoreConfig)
front:
  dashboard:
    graph1:
      # Variable URI to use for the visualization
      variable: "dev:id/variable/air_temperature_thermometer_degreecelsius"
```

Example, if the selected variable URI is : `dev:/id/variable/air_temperature_thermometer_degreecelsius`, the graphic will display the data of all devices measuring this variable.
It is then possible with the interface to filter the devices displayed and the periods chosen.

# Choice of the image to display if the data visualization is not configured

The instance logo or any other image can replace the data visualization component if no variable is defined for it.
You must add the image file in the images folder of your theme. (path by default : `front/theme/opensilex/images`).
The file must be called `dashboardLogo`. Accepted extensions are `.jpg`, `.png`, and `.svg`.


Definition of the chosen logo in `Dashboard.vue` component:

```Dashboard.vue
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  <img
    v-bind:src="$opensilex.getResourceURI('images/dashboardLogo', ['png', 'svg', 'jpg'])"
    class="dashboardCentralLogo"
    alt
  />
```

# Configuration of additional information for the data visualization

Graphic configuration for dataLocationInformations key :

```yaml
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Configuration for module: CoreModule (CoreConfig)
front:
  dashboard:
    graph1:
      dataLocationInformations: "Data from greenhouse 08 in Lezignan"
```

A box located above the graphic allows you to add informations for other users, concerning the data displayed. For example the location of the greenhouse from which the data are monitored.
