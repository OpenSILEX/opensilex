# Migrate to version 1.0.0-rc from 1.0.0-beta+2

## Change about API Data Model and DataFile Model

From version 1.0.0-rc, you have the ability to put data on other entities such as sites, areas, factors, etc. except people.  
So now, you have to use "target" instead of "scientificObject" in the API. This is also the case for importing data via the web interface.

If you already have data, you are concernd by this upgrade instruction.

In a mongodb console or client, chose your database and:
```
db.collection.dropIndexes()
db.getCollection('data').updateMany( {}, { $rename: { "scientificObject": "target" } } )
db.getCollection('file').updateMany( {}, { $rename: { "scientificObject": "target" } } )
```
