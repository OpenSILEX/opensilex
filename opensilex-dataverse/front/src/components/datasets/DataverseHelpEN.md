## General information on Recherche Data Gouv

From <a class="external-url-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://entrepot.recherche.data.gouv.fr/">Recherche Data Gouv's website</a> :
The _Recherche Data Gouv_ multidisciplinary repository is a sovereign solution for sharing and opening up data produced by communities that do not have a recognized disciplinary repository. It is based on the <a class="external-url-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://guides.dataverse.org/en/latest/">Dataverse</a> software. Data should be deposited in the space assigned to an institution which one of the contributor belongs to. A generic space is available for data produced by institutions which do not such a space yet themselves. Tests should be performed in the <a class="external-url-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://demo.recherche.data.gouv.fr/">sandbox</a>.
The latest news and events on the <a class="external-url-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://recherche.data.gouv.fr/en">Recherche Data Gouv platform</a>.

__Note :__ If the Recherche Data Gouv sandbox is used for your instance your data will be deleted on Recherche Data Gouv's side each month. You can ask your administrator to know if that is the case.
## About this integration of Opensilex with Recherche Data Gouv

This is a simple prototype version and still a work in progress. As such it has a few limitations :
* The integration is only one-way. It allows for the creation of a draft _Dataset_ on Recherche Data Gouv from metadata that is present on OpenSILEX.
* Once the creation of the _Dataset_ draft on OpenSILEX is done you should go to Recherche Data Gouv's website to verify the metadata, complete it, add the data and finally publish the dataset.
* If the _Dataset_ draft is deleted on Recherche Data Gouv's side it will not automatically be deleted on your OpenSILEX instance.
