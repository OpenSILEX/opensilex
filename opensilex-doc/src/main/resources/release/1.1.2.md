# Migrate to 1.1.0

## Credential migration

If you do not follow this step, accounts that are not administrators but has access to the account page before the migration will no longer have this access.

To solve this problem run the following command :

```bash
java -jar opensilex.jar --CONFIG_FILE=<config_file> system run-update AddAccountCredentialsToProfilWithUserCredential
```
