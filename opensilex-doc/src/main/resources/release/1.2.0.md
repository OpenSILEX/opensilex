# Migrate to 1.2.0

## Reset ontologies

Germplasm concept and properties were modified in this version. You will need to update the ontologies on your triple
store :

```
java -jar opensilex.jar --CONFIG_FILE=<config_file> sparql reset-ontologies
```

## Credential migration

If you do not follow this step, accounts that are not administrators but has access to the account page before the migration will no longer have this access.

To solve this problem run the following command :

```bash
java -jar opensilex.jar --CONFIG_FILE=<config_file> system run-update org.opensilex.migration.AddAccountCredentialsToProfilWithUserCredential
```

For more information about migration command and how to run it from your IDE see [migration_command.md](../how-to/migration_command.md)

## GDPR compliance

In this version, we have added a new feature to manage the GDPR compliance of the OpenSILEX instance. This feature is not enabled by default. To enable it, follow the instructions in the [GDPR_config.md](../installation/configuration/GDPR_config.md) file.

## New dashboard configuration
You can now configure additional information for the data visualization. For more information, see the [dashboard.md](../installation/configuration/dashboard.md#configuration-of-additional-information-for-the-data-visualization) file.
