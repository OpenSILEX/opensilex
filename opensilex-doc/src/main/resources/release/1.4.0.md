# Migrate to 1.4.0

## Reset ontologies

Modifications have been made to the core ontologies in this version. You will need to update the ontologies on your triple store :

```
java -jar opensilex.jar --CONFIG_FILE=<config_file> sparql reset-ontologies
```

## Data Insertion

- The POST `/core/data` service ("Add data") now use a limit of 10000 element instead of 50000 element. 

## Update Java 17

Please install java 17. We recommend using [sdkman kit](https://sdkman.io/) which make it easier to switch between
different Java versions, but you can also use your preferred installation method.

If you need to execute java version 11, you can build the project using profile -Pfor-java-11 (Ex ``mvn clean install -Pfor-java-11``)

## RDF4J migration

Migrate RDF4J from 3.7.4 to 5.0.3 by following the [migration guide](../../../../../opensilex-doc/src/main/resources/how-to/database_upgrade.md).

If you create your new repository in version 5.0.3 manually, please create an LMDB repository instead of a memory or 
native store. This allows for much better performance on a lot of queries.
