# Migrate to 1.5.0

## Migration of existing scientific objects which are created from Experiment with a relation: 'participatesIn'

- This command will add a relation between all Scientific Objects and Experiment when we create these from Experiment. If it is not done then there will be inconsistency in terms of SO data

```bash
java -jar opensilex.jar --CONFIG_FILE=<config_file> system run-update org.opensilex.migration.ScientificObjectAndExperimentRelationMigration --DEBUG
