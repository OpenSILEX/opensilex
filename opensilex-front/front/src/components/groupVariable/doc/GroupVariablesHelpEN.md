## Create variables groups

A group of variables is a regroupement of different variables.
It has a name and can have a description.
Its purpose is to improve the ergonomics of the interface and the user experience.

The group of variables allow us to regroup variables in order to classify them by the categories of our choice.
Let us take the case of experiments. When we browse through their details and go to the "Data" tab, we can normally visualise the list of variables associated to the experiment. We can filter the display by selecting only the variables that interest us.

Thanks to the groups of variables, the search is much less annoying, especially when there is a huge amount of variables associated.
We can filter by groups of variables and then select all the variables of a group by clicking on it.
Take for exemple a group containing all the environemental variables named "Group-Environement". If we want to filter the display with only the environemental variables, we can select "Group-Environement" and start the search. This saves us from searching and selecting all the environemental variables, especially if there are many of them.
