# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [1.0.0-rc+5]

> Warning : upgrading to this new version may require manual operations. Please
> see the [versioning notes](https://github.com/OpenSILEX/opensilex/blob/master/opensilex-doc/src/main/resources/release/1.0.0-rc+5.md).

> Warning: since version 1.0.0-rc+2, if you have created scientific objects with the same name in different experiments
> (with automatic URI generation), their URI would end up being the same. That may cause problems if you intended to create
> distinct scientific objects, such as some scientific objects being associated with the wrong data.
> 
> This bug has been fixed in this version. If you suspect that may have happened to you, please contact us ([opensilex-help@groupes.renater.fr](mailto:opensilex-help@groupes.renater.fr)).

## [1.0.0-rc+2] - 2022-01-23

Be carful, updating to this new version need to execute some actions. See [Versioning notes](https://github.com/OpenSILEX/opensilex/blob/master/opensilex-doc/src/main/resources/release/1.0.0-rc+2.md).
New installations don't need updating action.

### Added
- Concept of "Site" with an address : use W3C vcard specification.
- Filter on variables with filter in entity, entity of interest, characteristic, method, unit, group of variables
- Search in germplasm's attributs in Webapp
- Service in Ontology API to rename an URI.
- New filter on variable in Search Device service, for provenance's agent.
- Append FOAF.rdf ontology
- OpenSILEX migration modules with command.
- Command org.opensilex.migration.GraphAndCollectionMigration for SPARQL graph and MongoDB collection renaming after URI generation update

### Added in pre-production
- Visualisation og device value by variable. See. Variable / visualisation
- Species become optional in an experiment

###  Fixed or improvement
- **WARNING:** Update model graph from sets/<model_name> to set/<model_name>. Update URI generation by using "id" instead of "set" : **this improvement need an action**. See [Versioning notes](https://github.com/OpenSILEX/opensilex/blob/master/opensilex-doc/src/main/resources/release/1.0.0-rc+2.md) if updating.
- **WARNING:** Organization and Facilities ontologies. See [Versioning notes](https://github.com/OpenSILEX/opensilex/blob/master/opensilex-doc/src/main/resources/release/1.0.0-rc+2.md) if updating
- Control access in the Web interface, in progress
- Variable and device association on data creation
- Protect Device from removing when data exists
- Manage ambiguity of variable / device association at data creation
- API JSON message for duplicated attributes, or any kind of errors
- Remove experiment name using into URI generation
- Scientific Object tree filter, in progress
- Bugs fixed :
  - germplasm uri redirecting
  - all device type are linked to its root device type
  - others bugs

### Some Known Issues
- Problem of authentification when migrate. It's due to FOAF import. You need to remove `<http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/Agent> rdfs:label "Agent"`
- When installing other version, PHIS ontology is imported. You need to remove <http://www.opensilex.org/vocabulary/oeso-ext> context
- Some installation have problem with geospatial visualisation.
