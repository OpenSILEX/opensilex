# Migrate to 1.5.0

## Reset ontologies

Modifications have been made to the core ontologies in this version. You will need to update the ontologies on your triple store :

```
java -jar opensilex.jar --CONFIG_FILE=<config_file> sparql reset-ontologies
```

## Migration of existing scientific objects which are created from Experiment with a relation: 'participatesIn'

- This command will add a relation between all Scientific Objects and Experiment when we create these from Experiment. If it is not done then there will be inconsistency in terms of SO data

```bash
java -jar opensilex.jar --CONFIG_FILE=<config_file> system run-update org.opensilex.migration.ScientificObjectAndExperimentRelationMigration --DEBUG
```
