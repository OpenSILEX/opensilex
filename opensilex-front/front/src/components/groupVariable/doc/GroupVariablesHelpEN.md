# Variable Groups help

## Create variable groups

A group of variables is a collection of different variables.
It has a name and can have a description.
Its purpose is to improve the ergonomics of the interface and the user experience.

## Its use

The group of variables allows us to classify variables by categories of our choice.
Let us take the case of experiments. When we browse through their details and go to the "Data" tab, we can normally visualise the list of variables associated to the experiment. We can filter the display by selecting only the variables that interest us.

Thanks to variable groups, the search is much less annoying, especially when there is a huge amount of associated variables.
We can instead filter by groups of variables and then select all the variables of that group by clicking on it.
Take for example a group containing all the environmental variables named "Group-Environment". If we want to filter the display with only the environmental variables, we can select "Group-Environment" and start the search. This saves us from searching and selecting all the environmental variables one by one, especially if there are many of them.
