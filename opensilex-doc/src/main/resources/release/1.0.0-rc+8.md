# Migrate to 1.0.0-rc+8

## Configuration file

### Shared resource instances

In the case Shared Resource Instances (SRI) are defined in your configuration file, you have to update the declarations. 

Previously, a shared resource instance was configured like this :

```yaml
core:
sharedResourceInstances:
  - uri: http://phenome.inrae.fr/resources/rest
    label:
        fr: "PHENOME"
        en: "PHENOME"
    accountName: guest@opensilex.org
    accountPassword: guest
```

The `apiUrl` key was added to distinguish the identifier of the SRI from the API endpoint. This caused problems when
changing the API endpoint of an SRI. For most cases, you should be able to duplicate the `uri` key, like this :

```yaml
core:
  sharedResourceInstances:
    - uri: http://phenome.inrae.fr/resources/rest
      apiUrl: http://phenome.inrae.fr/resources/rest # Duplicate the "uri" line and rename it "apiUrl"
      label:
        fr: "PHENOME"
        en: "PHENOME"
      accountName: guest@opensilex.org
      accountPassword: guest
```
