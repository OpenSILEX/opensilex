# Germplasm Groups help

## Create germplasm groups

A group of germplasm is a collection of different germplasm.
It has a name and can have a description.
Its purpose is to improve the ergonomics of the interface and the user experience.

## Its use

The group of germplasm allows us to classify germplasm by categories of our choice.

This concept is therefore used for filtering genetic material, but also scientific objects. For example, until now to
filter out scientific objects whose germplasms are not descendants of the Syrah type vine, we would have had to select each
germplasm individually. With this new concept, this search is much easyer because we could just create a Groupe-Syrah that
would contain all the Syrah type germplasms.

Au niveau de module 'germplasm', nous pouvons chercher un groupe et visualiser les germplasms qu'il contient, ou
inversement, chercher un germplasm et visualiser Ã  quel groupe appartient-il.

On the 'Germplasm' tab, we can search by group to see what germplasms are contained in that group, or vise-versa, search a germplasm to see what groups it is part of.
