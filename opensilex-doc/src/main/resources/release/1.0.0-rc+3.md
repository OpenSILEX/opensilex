## Factors categories

### Change about API Factor Category Model

From version 1.0.0-rc+1, we will use PECO ontology to represent experimental factor instead of AGROVOC thesaurus.
Also in this version, you will be able to add new or specialize existing factor categories.

#### SPARQL script to run

If you already have create factors in experiments, you are concerned by this upgrade instruction.

Remove unnecessary graph

```sparql
  CLEAR GRAPH <http://aims.fao.org/aos/agrovoc/factors>
}
```

Remove links to previous factor category

```sparql
PREFIX vocabulary: <http://www.opensilex.org/vocabulary/oeso#>

DELETE{
  ?factor  vocabulary:hasCategory  ?category
}WHERE{
  ?factor  vocabulary:hasCategory  ?category
}
```

You must fill new category factors in existing factors.
