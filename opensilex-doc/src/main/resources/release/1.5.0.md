# Migrate to 1.5.0

## Reset ontologies

Modifications have been made to the core ontologies in this version. You will need to update the ontologies on your triple store :

```
java -jar opensilex.jar --CONFIG_FILE=<config_file> sparql reset-ontologies
```

## Migrations

### Migration of existing scientific objects which are created from Experiment with a relation: 'participatesIn'

- This command will add a relation between all Scientific Objects and Experiment when we create these from Experiment. If it is not done then there will be inconsistency in terms of SO data

```bash
java -jar opensilex.jar --CONFIG_FILE=<config_file> system run-update org.opensilex.migration.ScientificObjectAndExperimentRelationMigration --DEBUG
```

### Migration of Facilities location models:

```shell
# Connect to a console in OpenSILEX server
# From the directory which contains your OpenSILEX executable .jar file
java -jar opensilex.jar --CONFIG_FILE=<config_file> system run-update org.opensilex.migration.UpdateFacilitiesWithLocationObservationCollectionModel
```

See the migration `org.opensilex.migration.UpdateFacilitiesWithLocationObservationCollectionModel`
from [migration_command.md](../how-to/migration_command.md) for additional notes
